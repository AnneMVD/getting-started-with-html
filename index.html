  <p>The Basics of the <b>Web</b> and <b>HTML</b></p>

<p>The <b>Web</b> is a collection of documents.<br>
It's sort of like a library. It can keep lots of different things: text, pictures, videos, etc. <br>
But the biggest part of the web is <b>HTML</b>.</p>

<p><b>HTML</b> is a language that tells the computer how to show all the things on the web. <br>
One way to think about it is to imagine HTML is a hi-tech display case.<br>
It doesn't permanently change the thing you are showing, it just lets you look at it in a different way.<br>
For example, look at these items in their display cases:
</p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Museum_display_cases-4_glass_sides_display_case_副本.jpg" alt="items in display cases">
</p>

<p>Imagine you could shine a light on the cases to emphasize the contents within.<br>
You could slant the cases to the side so we'd have to look at them on an angle.<br> 
You could move the middle case to the end so it's in a different position, or move them away from each other so there are big spaces in between each case.<br>
These hi-tech cases even have zoom lenses to make everything inside look bigger or smaller.<br>
But remember, you can always take the item out of the case and it's back to its original state. Then you can put it in a new case to make it look different all over again!<br>
<br>
These hi-tech display cases can even show things or bring things that are located in a different case somewhere in the world.<br>
And most amazingly, certain display cases can even bring you to a different room of display cases if you touch it.<br>
We call these special connections references and <em>hyperlinks</em>.<br>
<br>
This is what HTML does to all the text, pictures, videos, etc on the web.<br>
All of these things need display cases to show them correctly on the web, so as you can imagine that there is a lot of HTML on the web.</p> 

<p>Communicating in <b>HTML</b></p>
<p>Like all languages, HTML has a vocabulary. And HTML uses this vocabulary to tell the computer how to show things.
<br> 
And for some things, we tell the computer to start showing something a certain way, but we also need to tell the computer to stop showing it a certain way.<br>
So computers that communicate in HTML are a little "stupid". If we don't tell it to stop doing certain things, it will keep going like an Energizer bunny on a perpetual motion battery.<br>
So we have to be sensitive to how the computer understands HTML. It requires a little different thinking than English or even talking to humans.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of HTML doesn't use words, it uses <em>tags</em>. These are sets of symbols that tell a computer to show something, for example, as<br>
<em>emphasized</em><br>
<b>bold</b><br>
or even<br>
<br>
spaced<br>
<br>
apart.<br>

When we combine these symbols with the thing we want to show, it''s an <em>element</em><br>
Elements can also be either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine writing a school essay or notes on a piece of ruled paper. We usualy write across the page, staying on one line until we run out of room.<br>
Then we go to the next line and keep writing across until we run out of page.<br>
Sometimes are sentences are short so we don't have to go all the way to the end of the page.<br>
But we still start the next sentence on the next line at the beginning and go until we run out of room or don't need anyore room. Then we go to the next line.<br>
HTML Inline Elements are similar becase they like to stick to the lines.<br>

But Block Elements don't stick to the lines. They stick to boxes.<br>
<br>
Think about this picture:
<p>
<img src="http://orientation.ucsc.edu/admissions-copy/orientation/resource-guide/images/notes2.jpg?t=0" alt="notepaper divided into sections">
</p>
If you were taking notes using this paper, would you start writing info in the "cue" section and just write all the way across into the "lecture notes" section?<br> 
No, you would get to the line and move your pen back to the left edge of the page before writing any more. The lecture section is for different info.<br>
So block elements are sort of like this, they stay in their boxes, even if we can't visibly see the boxes in our HTML or on the webpage.</p>

<p>HTML has a lot of tags and elements we can use so we can find a lot of different ways to show all the stuff on the web!</p>
<br>
I just made this! It's awesome!<br>
